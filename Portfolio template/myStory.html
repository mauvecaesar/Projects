            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I have always been inclined towards the artistic part of development i.e. Design.</p>
            <p>I started to explore my designing skills with Graphic Design and tried my hand working with
            tools like Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign.</p>
            <p>Thenafter, I gradually shifted towards Web Design and started learning the common Front-end
            Development tools namely HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
            <p>Pursuing my creative interest further, I got to learn Photography and took it further alongwith
            my technical skills.</p>
            <p>That's all for my Story. Hope you enjoyed reading it :)</p>
